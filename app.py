# "import" brings code from another package into this file.
# In JavaScript you would write: import { FastAPI } from "fastapi"
# In Python the same idea is written as: from <package> import <thing>
from fastapi import FastAPI


# FastAPI is a class. Calling it with () creates an object (an "instance").
# There is no "new" keyword in Python -- calling the class IS creating the object.
# JavaScript equivalent: const app = new FastAPI()
app = FastAPI(title="Gen AI Beginner Basics")


# A "decorator" is the @ line below. It attaches extra behaviour to a function.
# This one tells FastAPI: "when a GET request arrives at the URL /, run home()"
# The function itself stays a plain, normal function.
@app.get("/")
def home():
    # "def" defines a function. The colon and the indentation replace { }.
    # "return" sends a value back, exactly like JavaScript.
    # The { } below is a DICTIONARY -- Python's version of a JS object.
    # Keys must be in quotes. FastAPI converts this dictionary into JSON for us.
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
